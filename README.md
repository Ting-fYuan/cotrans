# Cotrans

Cotrans is a collaborative online image/manga translation platform base on [manga-image-translator](https://github.com/zyddnys/manga-image-translator). \
One can view translated image/manga in browser through our tampermonkey extension or in apps if their developers choose to integrate Cotrans in them. \
One can edit translation of an existing image/manga, add their own translation to an image/manga or simply request auto translation to read online image/manga.

## Browser extension

For users with tampermonkey installed, you can download our extension from [here](https://github.com/VoileLabs/imgtrans-userscript). \
